# Mapping the Bioinformatics Job Landscape: Trends, Skills, and Opportunities Revealed through Text Mining Analysis

## Abstract
The rapid evolution of biological data acquisition and big data systems has transformed the bioinformatics landscape, leading to a surge in job postings. To understand market dynamics and success factors, we analyzed 2,016 bioinformatics job advertisements from November 2021 using text-mining techniques to identify key knowledge domains and skills, developing a taxonomy of these competencies. Our study found a high demand for professionals with at least five years of experience, particularly in roles such as bioinformatics scientists, analysts, and specialists. Key technologies include RNA-seq and Python, alongside essential research, development, and innovation skills. Additionally, technical proficiencies and soft skills like motivation, autonomy, and initiative are highly valued. These insights guide educational and career strategies, highlighting critical trends and aiding informed decision-making for bioinformatics professionals and students.
